##### These days a great many people consider composing to be a threadbare craft mastered solely by the goldsmiths of music. Our team dared to prove them wrong and bestow a salvatory instrument upon pilgrims of music. In a nutshell, we introduce a gaming pad, rigged with motion and proximity sensors, which are designed to give the composer an illustratory method of expressing his artistic concepts. Every single relocation of your hand above the pad will grant you with infinite possibilities of sound's modulation. The frequency of signal, nature of sound, volume can be inflected by the swings of your bare hands. The wizardry is attained by assorted compond algorithms inside a computer as well as by meticulously integrated hardware. For comprehensive breakdown of technical groundwork check out the documentation in the *Artifacts* section below.
